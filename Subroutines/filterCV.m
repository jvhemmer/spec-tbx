function filteredCurrent = filterCV(time, current, frequencies, options)
%timeFromCV: Calculates time-based array to plot with current from CV data.
%
%   Arguments:
%       time:           time data (must analyze time-domain, not potential).
%       current:        current data.
%       frequencies:      frequency that must be filtered out.
%       filterRange:    range of frequencies about the desired frequency
%                       that will be filtered. For example, for a filter at
%                       20 Hz with a range of 2 Hz, the frequencies 18â€’22
%                       Hz will be filtered out (default 1 Hz).
